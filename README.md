# quiz-game

This is a CLI quiz game application. It employs the use of json data to act as a pseudo database of questions and answers. It also implements the usage of two classes, a question class, as well as a quiz class. The question class is used to construct question objects to be inputted for the quiz constructor to create the quiz. The quiz class keeps track of how many questions there are, what question the user is on, and whether the user answered the question correctly and keeps score of the correct answers.
